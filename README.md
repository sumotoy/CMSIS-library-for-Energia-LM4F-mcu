CMSIS-library-for-Energia-LM4F-mcu
==================================

CMSIS DSP libraries for **Energia IDE, LM4F** at core level, just an experiment that worked. I grabbed from Teensy3 core.

To install, drop files as they are organized inside the .zip<br>
To use, put  ```#include <arm_math.h>``` at the top of your sketch.
